Get/Download the runtime wasm from a running node through rpc

USAGE:
    subwasm get [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -b, --block <block>      The optional block where to fetch the runtime. That allows fetching
                             older runtimes but you will need to connect to archive nodes.
                             Currently, you must pass a block hash. Passing the block numbers is not
                             supported
    -o, --output <output>    You may specifiy the output filename where the runtime will be saved.
                             If not provided, we will figure out an appropriate default name based
                             on a counter: runtime_NNN.wasm where NNN is incrementing to make sure
                             you do not override previous runtime. If you specify an existing file
                             as output, it will be overwritten
    -u, --url <url>          The node url. Example: ws://localhost:9944 or http://localhost:9933
                             [default: http://localhost:9933]
